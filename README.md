# Simple Database Management System Using Bash Shell Scription

This project was created during my ITI 3 months internship as a project for bash shell scripting course

## Main Idea

The Project acts as very simple DBMS where you can : 

- ( Create / Drop / List) Databases
- Connect to specific Database
- List a DB tables
- ( Select From / Create / Update / Insert into ) these tables
